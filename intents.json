         "responses": ["Navigating to Parental stress management module ... \n\n Parents want the best for their child and it's also their job to nudge and guide their child towards what’s best for them. But there is a thin line between caring and caring too much. The latter can smother the child under the burden of heavy expectations. \n   1.Be assertive: Convey your feelings and thoughts with clarity without being hurtful or raising your voice. You may have to be like a stuck record and repeat the same thing multiple times to be heard but do keep calm whenever conveying the message. Else the focus will shift from the content of your message to your tone of voice and defeat its purpose.\n   2.Boundaries: It's an imaginary line you draw around yourself to preserve emotional energy and define what and how much you allow into your life. So if your parents have an opinion about something related to your life that you differ with, state it using ‘I’ statements instead of ‘You’ statements. eg: “I would like to be given some space to think about this’.\n   3.Ask yourself what about this pressure troubles me? Why does it trouble me? How do I feel? What do I believe I deserve?\n   4.Don't argue to win but to understand their point of view. Keep the focus of the conversation on the topic and not bring past history and other topics into the discussion.\n   5.Instead of making assumptions about why they want you to do something ask them. Listen to what they have to say without jumping to conclusions. Make space for their thoughts and experiences too.\n  In case you and/or loved ones require support, please reach out!\n"]

         "responses": ["Navigating to Stress management module ... \n\n  If you think your teen is under too much stress, you can help your child learn to manage it. Here are some tips: \n\n   1.Spend time together. Try to spend some time alone with your teen each week. Even if your teen does not accept, they will notice that you offered. Get involved by managing or coaching their sports team, or by taking part in school activities. Or, simply attend games, concerts, or plays he or she is involved with.\n   2.Learn to listen. Listen openly to your teen's concerns and feelings, and share positive thoughts. Ask questions, but do not interpret or jump in with advice unless you are asked. This type of open communication may make your teen more willing to discuss their stress with you.\n   3.Be a role model. Whether you know it or not, your teen looks to you as a model for healthy behavior. Do your best to keep your own stress under control and manage it in healthy ways.\n   4.Get your teen moving. Getting regular exercise is one of the best ways to beat stress, for both adults and teens. Encourage your teens to find an exercise they enjoy, whether it is team sports or other activities like yoga, wall climbing, swimming, dancing, or hiking. You might even suggest trying a new activity together.\n   5.Keep an eye on sleep. Teens need plenty of shut-eye. Not getting enough sleep makes it harder to manage stress. Try to make sure your teen gets at least 8 hours of sleep a night. This can be a challenge between school hours and homework. One way to help is by limiting screen time, both TV and computer, in the evening before bed.\n   6.Teach work management skills. Teach your teen some basic ways to manage tasks, such as making lists or breaking larger tasks into smaller ones and doing one piece at a time.\n   7.Stock up on healthy foods. Like many adults, teens often reach for unhealthy snacks when they are under stress. To help them resist the urge, fill your fridge and cabinets with veggies, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Skip the sodas and high-calorie, sugary snacks.\n   8.Create family rituals. Family routines can be comforting for your teen during stressful times. Having a family dinner or movie night can help relieve the stress of the day and give you a chance to connect.\n   9.Do not demand perfection. None of us does everything perfectly. Expecting perfection from your teen is unrealistic and just adds stress.\n"]
